# Solidity-Factory-Pattern Implementation

With the factory pattern we can create as many instances of the same contract

In this case I have build a React application where user can create ERC20 tokens at one click

Also they can get the addresses of tokens they have deployed. 

The smart contracts are deployed on BSC testnet. 

## Tools Used

- React
- Ethers.js
